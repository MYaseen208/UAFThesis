\textbf{\huge Dedication}\\
The Sublime Love\\
Of\\
My Beloved and Kind Parents\\
Who taught me,\\
The first step to take,\\
The first word to speak,\\
The first Alphabet to write,\\
Inspired me to higher ideas of life,\\
Whose hands always rose in prayer for me,\\
Who are with me to feel the bud of their wishes and prayers blooming into a flower
And\\
Under whose feet my heaven lies
